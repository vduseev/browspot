# browspot
High-level library that helps you to work with PrimeSense and Kinect sensors.

Unfortunately, PrimeSense and Kinect sstructured lights sensors are not manufactured anymore and there are better options on the market. Also with PrimeSense's acquisition by Apple the OpenNI library upon which ***browspot*** is built has stopped it's evolution and now is just maintained by [Structure.io](structure.io). 

Thus, ***browspot*** development has no practical sense, and this repository exists as a showcase of some programming techniques:
* Working with OpenNI API
* Designing higher level API
* Isolating actual sensor interaction library from GUI
* IMplementing GUI control panel with QT
